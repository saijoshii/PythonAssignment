'''Modify the "Times Table" again so that the user still enters the number of the table,
 but if this number is negative the table is printed backwards. So entering "-7"
 would produce the Seven Times Table starting at "12 times" down to "0 times".'''

# Ask the user for the number of the table
num = int(input("Enter the number of the times table you want (0-12 or negative for reverse): "))
